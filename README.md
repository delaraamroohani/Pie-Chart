# Pie-Chart
Create a pie chart (py chart? :D) using python turtle graphics.

I wrote this program back in year 11, when I had learned about programming for the first time, and I was learning python.
I remember being very very excited about it! [My programming teacher](https://github.com/rbabaee) told me to make a github profile, and upload my code to it.
It was a bit too overwhelming for me then. I made my profile, but never uploaded anything.
I think it's time now :)
